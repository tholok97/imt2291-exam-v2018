Did not have time to finish this task. I'd like to explain what I have done 
and what is left:

# What has been done

* The component receives a json object and sets value and path aruments like specified
* The component renders only the properties in given path (here pathArray)
* The component recursively digs down into the object to do it's rendering
* Path and value work correctly, although they are formatted somewhat strange

# What is left to do

* The component is currently non-interactive. The path is set at creation time 
  (hardcoded to demonstrate it in action), and cannot be set by clicking on properties
* The component does not show arrays and property values in the pretty fashion that the 
  demo in the task description did. with my component you'll have to infer them from the value field
* Component only works on properties, not arrays

# How I would solve the remaining tasks:

* I've started a recursive function that digs down into the object and displays 
  appropriate properties. I would continue by making this function render arrays 
  properly, and making the inserted properties clickable somehow (simple link? 
  onclick attribute?). The properties would lauch another function that would set 
  the this.pathArray
* I've used this.pathArray to specify how far down into the object the user is. I would 
  extend it by somehow allowing for digging into arrays (this is currently not possible)
* I would fix the formatting of rendered object and path and value fields to match 
that of the demo in the task description
